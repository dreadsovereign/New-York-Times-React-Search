# New York Times Reach Search

With this application, users can search for New York Times articles by topic, and by year (using start year and end year for a range of years).

Once the search results are returned, the user has a few options. Each search result has a summary of the article, a link to the article on the New York Times website, and a button to save the article. 

If the user saves the article, it is stored in MongoDB. Once an article is saved, the saved articles will appear in the "Saved Articles" section of the page. If the user wishes to remove any articles from the Saved Article section, they can click on the "Delete" button. 

The application utilizes Node, Express, React, MongoDB, and the New York Times API.
